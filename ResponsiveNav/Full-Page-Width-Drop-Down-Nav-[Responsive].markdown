Full Page Width Drop Down Nav [Responsive]
------------------------------------------
This is a basic horizontal Navigation Menu that stretches the full width of the browser window. The Menu includes drop-down capabilities as well as CSS transition effects. Media Queries included in the CSS make it fully responsive - as the window shrinks, so does the menu, eventually transforming into a stacked Navigation.
